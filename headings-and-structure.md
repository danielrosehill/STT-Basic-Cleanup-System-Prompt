# Adding Structure with Headings

Beyond paragraph formatting, adding appropriate headings can significantly enhance the readability and organization of STT-generated content.

## Enhanced System Prompt

```
Add subheadings to make the edited text more readable. The subheading should summarize or capture the main essence of the coming section of text. Do not add more than one subheading every 400 words.
```

## The Importance of Constraints

When instructing an AI to add headings, it's crucial to include constraints. Without them, the AI may add headings too frequently, creating a choppy and disjointed reading experience.

The instruction to limit headings to "no more than one every 400 words" prevents the AI from going overboard. This constraint was developed through trial and error, finding that without it, the AI tends to add subheadings after nearly every paragraph.

## Benefits of Strategic Headings

1. **Improved navigation**: Readers can quickly scan and find relevant sections
2. **Enhanced comprehension**: Headings provide context and framing for the content that follows
3. **Better retention**: Information organized under clear headings is easier to remember
4. **Visual breaks**: Headings create natural pauses in the text, reducing cognitive load
5. **SEO advantages**: When used in online content, headings improve search engine optimization

## Implementation Guidelines

When adding this component to your system prompt, consider:

- **Consistency**: Headings should follow a consistent style and format
- **Relevance**: Each heading should accurately reflect the content that follows
- **Hierarchy**: For longer content, consider specifying a heading hierarchy (H2, H3, etc.)
- **Length**: Headings should be concise but descriptive (typically 3-7 words)

## Example Application

This component works particularly well for:

- Long-form content (articles, reports, documentation)
- Instructional content with distinct sections
- Complex topics that benefit from clear organization
- Content that will be referenced rather than read linearly

By adding appropriate headings, your STT-generated content becomes not just readable, but truly usable and professional.
