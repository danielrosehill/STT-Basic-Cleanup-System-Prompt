A collection of system prompts for cleaning up and formatting text generated by speech-to-text (STT) software.

## Introduction

This repository contains system prompts designed to transform raw speech-to-text output into polished, readable content. While I've created specialized prompts for specific formats like emails and meeting notes, the most essential one is what I call a "cleanup prompt."

I've found that using a well-crafted cleanup prompt can significantly improve the quality of STT-generated text. Through trial and error, I've developed prompts that strike the right balance between fixing common STT issues and preserving your authentic voice.

The key insight I've discovered is explicitly instructing the AI that the text was generated by STT software. This primes it to address common deficiencies while maintaining your unique style and perspective.

## Components of the System Prompt

This repository is organized into several components, each building upon the previous to create a comprehensive system prompt:

### [Basic Text Cleanup](basic-cleanup.md)
The foundation of any STT cleanup system prompt. Addresses common issues like pause words, missing punctuation, and typos.

### [Formatting for Internet Readability](formatting-for-internet.md)
Transforms walls of text into short, readable paragraphs suitable for emails, blogs, and social media.

### [Instruction Parsing](instruction-parsing.md)
Enables the AI to separate and follow editing instructions embedded within the dictated text.

### [Adding Structure with Headings](headings-and-structure.md)
Improves readability by adding appropriate subheadings to break up text.

### [Examples and Templates](examples.md)
Before/after examples to guide the AI's editing style.

### [Complete System Prompt](complete-system-prompt.md)
The full system prompt combining all components for optimal results.

This repository is part of a larger collection of specialized system prompts for speech-to-text applications. For more specialized prompts (emails, meeting notes, etc.), check out the [Speech-To-Text System Prompt Library](https://github.com/danielrosehill/Speech-To-Text-System-Prompt-Library).

## Key Principles

1. **Balance correction with authenticity** - Fix STT issues without making text sound robotic
2. **Preserve the user's voice** - Maintain the unique style and perspective of the original
3. **Improve readability** - Structure text with appropriate paragraphs and headings
4. **Follow embedded instructions** - Parse and apply any editing directions within the text

## Usage

These prompts can be used with any LLM that accepts system prompts, particularly in conjunction with speech-to-text software like [Voicenotes](https://voicenotes.com) or OpenAI's Whisper.
